hs-cvsu v.0.1.0

Haskell bindings for the cvsu library.

This library contains bindings to the c code in cvsu library, based on
bindings-dsl, haskell types wrapped around them, and many functions for
utilizing the scene understanding features of cvsu.

This is research-grade code for my PhD project and may be useful to others as
well, but no guarantees are given. The master branch should be in usable state
most of the time, while the dev branch contains new, experimental features.

The most up-to-date version will be always available in repository
git@github.com:amnipar/hs-cvsu.git

Installation:

Haskell platform (at least version 2012.0.0.2) is required for using this.

cabal-dev is recommended for experimenting with this library, though normal
cabal works as well.

At the moment you need to get the c sources of cvsu into hs-cvsu directory
(in sub-directory c):

cd hs-cvsu
git clone git@github.com:amnipar/cvsu.git c
cabal-dev install

You can also host the cvsu code in another path and use a symbolic link in the
hs-cvsu folder:

ch hs-cvsu
ln -s /path/to/cvsu c

Note:
If you are using hs-cvsu together with the CV library
git://github.com/aleator/CV.git
then you will need to get also the cv-cvsu library:
git@github.com:amnipar/cv-cvsu.git
which contains some utilities for combining CV with cvsu. For example, it will
enable using the opencv library for opening any image files, converting the
CV image types to cvsu PixelImage's, and using opencv drawing functions for
visualizing various data structures.

Many of the example applications rely on CV library at the moment. I will make
the effort to provide later examples also without the CV requirement.The CV
functionalities are separated from the basic hs-cvsu library to enable using it
also without having to install opencv. This comes with the limitation that only
pnm image files (.pbm/.pgm/.ppm) are supported.
