hs-cvsu v.0.1.0

Haskell bindings for the cvsu library.

This library contains bindings to the c code in cvsu library, based on
bindings-dsl, haskell types wrapped around them, and many functions for
utilizing the scene understanding features of cvsu.

This is research-grade code for my PhD project and may be useful to others as
well, but no guarantees are given. The master branch should be in usable state
most of the time, while the dev branch contains new, experimental features.

The most up-to-date version will be always available in repository
git@github.com:amnipar/hs-cvsu.git

Installation:

cabal-dev is recommended for experimenting with this library, though normal
cabal works as well.

At the moment you need to get the c sources of cvsu into hs-cvsu directory
(in sub-directory c):

cd hs-cvsu
git clone git@yousource.it.jyu.fi:cvsu/cvsu.git c
cabal-dev install

You can also host the cvsu code in another path and use a symbolic link in the
hs-cvsu folder.
